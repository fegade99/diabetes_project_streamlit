# Data Science Project Boilerplate

This boilerplate is designed to kickstart data science projects by providing a basic setup for database connections, data processing, and machine learning model development. It includes a structured folder organization for your datasets and a set of pre-defined Python packages necessary for most data science tasks.

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `app.py` - The main Python script that you run for your project.
- `explore.py` - A notebook to explore data, play around, visualize, clean, etc. Ideally the notebook code should be migrated to the app.py when moving to production.
- `utils.py` - This file contains utility code for operations like database connections.
- `requirements.txt` - This file contains the list of necessary python packages.
- `models/` - This directory should contain your SQLAlchemy model classes.
- `data/` - This directory contains the following subdirectories:
  - `interin/` - For intermediate data that has been transformed.
  - `processed/` - For the final data to be used for modeling.
  - `raw/` - For raw data without any processing.
 
    
## Setup

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed on your. You will also need pip for installing the Python packages.

**Installation**

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
